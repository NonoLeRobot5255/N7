== introduction: 
Immigration is a really important subject all around the world. It is a subject that is discussed in every continent and in every country. This subject impact millions of peoples and millions of lives. not juste lives of thos who are immigrating but also the lives of those who are already living in the country. The Russian Federation is a country that care a lot about peoples who are already living in the country, this is why the country has a really strict policu in term of immigration. 

== Countryâ€™s Background on the Issue:
In 1950, In the Soviet Union, the government had a really strict policy for immigration. The world war 2 just finish and it was the begining of the cold war. The country emigrate at this time many peoples too to help actual Ukraine and Belarus to reconstruct their country. It make the migrations satistics of the actual Russia really down. 

In 1975 a migration flow start from others soviet union country to actual Russia, wich increase the population of the country and make the migration statistics go up. 

In 1991, the Soviet Union collapse and the country become the Russian Federation. On this event, the country discussed about her immigration policy and had decided to open the immigration to the world, we can see at this period that th immigration rate was really good and the emigration rate was down, that means that the country was really attractive and open to peoples. Workers come in the country to work and gain money.

In 2000 a demography crisis start, there were many less birth and a lot of more death, this decrease the population really fast, that's why the government decide to deal with immigration, to compense the decrease of the population. The government attact the Russian-speaking peoples particulary. But the economical crisis that affect the country made the a big difficulty for Russia to attract peoples.

In 2010, the government choose to renforce the migration laws to avoid non-legal immigrates peoples, it reduce the number of immigrantes workers that come in Russia.
But, at the same time, a great crisis start in Ukraine, wich make Ukrainian peoples to run out of Ukraine and emmigrates to Russia, wich make a big incoming of peoples to Russia.

Since 2010, the migration is a big issue for the Russia, there is the COVID-19 crisis that stop migration flow and after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia that make Ukrainian to run in Russia to protect themself and Russians that left the country to not go to the war.


== Curent poilcies

Russia faces significant demographic challenges, with an aging population and declining birth rates. To address this, the government has implemented strict yet strategic immigration policies that aim to manage the influx of foreign workers while preserving national security and cultural identity. The current policies can be seen as a delicate balance between welcoming much-needed immigrants and maintaining strict control over who enters the country.

== Proposed solution 

For the Russia, it's important to keep the immigration open but to filter it to keep a security level for the country, this is why there is some points that Russia want :

+ *Apply a selective immigration poilicie :* Russia think that if we apply a good verification of the migrants by their profesion, status etc... We will avoid security prolemes.

+ *Special Programs for Russian-Speaking Immigrants: * The Russia think that if we took natives Russian speakers, we will have easy communication and they will acomodate fast to their new lives 

+ *renforce border securtiy:* If we pay attention to the border, we can be sure about what is entering in the country and we will know exactly what is happening and we can do a great job so to protect the country.
